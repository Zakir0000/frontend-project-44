<h2 id="brain-even">Brain-even (game: "Checking Parity")</h2>
In the "Brain-even" game, you will be presented with a series of random numbers. Your task is to determine whether each number is even or odd. If the number is even, you should answer 'yes'. If the number is odd, you should answer 'no'.

The game continues until you give the wrong answer or until you correctly answer three questions in a row. If you provide an incorrect answer, the game will end immediately.

Your goal is to achieve a streak of three consecutive correct answers to win the game.
